Domain : DEVOPS

Duration : July 5th - August 5th

Mentor : MUZAMMIL AHMED

Task : TASK ONE -CI/CD PIPELINE WITH JENKINS

Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Install and configure Jenkins. Create a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy a simple application.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT.

Project : Web Application Portfolio using Java,SpringBoot,Gradle & Jenkins

Objective:
Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

Key Activities:

Install and Configure Jenkins:
*Installed Jenkins on the local machine.
*Configured Jenkins with necessary plugins for Git, Gradle, and Java.

Create a Jenkins Pipeline:
*Defined a Jenkins pipeline script to automate the build, test, and deployment of a simple web application.
*Used Jenkinsfile for pipeline as code.

Build Process:
*Configured Gradle as the build tool in Jenkins.
*Set up the build process to compile the Java application.

Test Process:
*Integrated JUnit tests into the pipeline.
*Automated the execution of unit tests during the build process.

Deployment Process:
*Configured deployment steps to deploy the application to a local server or cloud environment.

Tools Used:
*Jenkins: For CI/CD automation.
*Java: Programming language for the web application.
*Spring Boot: Framework for building the web application.
*Gradle: Build automation tool.
*JUnit: Testing framework for unit tests.

Features:
>>Automated Builds: Jenkins automates the build process using Gradle.
>>Automated Testing: Integration of JUnit tests for automated test execution.
>>Continuous Deployment: Jenkins pipeline automates the deployment of the application.
>>Pipeline as Code: Use of Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline in code, enabling version control and easy modifications.

Conclusion:
The CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins significantly improves the efficiency and reliability of the software development process by automating critical steps like building, testing, and deploying the application. This ensures faster delivery of updates and higher software quality, enhancing overall development productivity.
